# These variables are what could be in an Ansible Vault file
# which would encrypt them and allow them to be kept in a
# public repo, without prying eyes being able to see them.

# These variables (and any other variables or files [SSH
# keys, etc]) which should be kept secret should be stored
# in an entirely different repo or directory, a 'private'
# place. Then, files can be encrypted with Ansible Vault or
# some other mechanism, and you can allow the 'ansible'
# and/or 'ansible-playbook' scripts access to those secret
# files as necessary.
