D2 Deployments
==============

This directory is used to consolidate deployment related files
for specific deployment infrastructure (e.g., cloud service
providers, local Vagrant, etc.) in their own subdirectories.
This helps keep things organized and modularized.

Each deployment directory should have a matching inventory
directory in $PBR/environments.

| Directory | Description  |
