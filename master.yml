# This is the master playbook. It includes all the other playbooks. 
# Usually you would call it with a -t tagname to only run a specific tag 
# over all machines.

# (This playbook is based on master.yml in the Fedora Project
# Ansible playbook Git repository.)

# -t updates -e packages_upgrade=yes  -> upgrades packages
