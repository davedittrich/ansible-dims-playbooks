%(_progname)s [options] [args]

Use "%(_progname)s --help" to see options.
Use "%(_progname)s --usage" to see help on "bumpversion" itself.

%(_progname)s -- [bumpversion_options] [bumpversion_args]

Follow this second usage example and put -- before any bumpversion
options and arguments to pass them on bumpversion (rather than
process them as though they were %(_progname)s arguments.) After
all, %(_progname)s is just a shell wrapping bumpversion.
