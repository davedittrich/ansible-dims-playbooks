This script is intended to facilitate editing Sphinx documentation by running
a Sphinx autobuild session for a Git repository. It makes some attempt to find
the Sphinx docs directory and running sphinx-autobuild from there. (Note that
this assumes the directory structure \$REPOBASE/docs/source for the location
where a Sphinx conf.py file should be found.)
