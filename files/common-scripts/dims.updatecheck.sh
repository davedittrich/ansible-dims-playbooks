This script is designed to check for package updates and/or required
reboot status using the DIMS bats tests "system/updates" and
"system/reboot". If either test fails, the output is mailed to
the system administrator. This script is designed to be run
from a cron job or systemd timer.

Host: ${_hostname}
Date: ${_now}

This report was triggered due to the results of running tests for
available package updates and/or required reboot status. Here are
the results:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
test.runner --tap --match "updates|reboot"

$(cat ${_tmpout})

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

If package updates are necessary, this can be accomplished by running
the Ansible playbook for ${_hostname} with the following options:

   --tags updates -e packages_update=true

If a reboot is necessary, ensure that the reboot is handled in
a controlled manner:

  o Ensure that all users of external services are aware of any
    potential outage of services provided by this host (or its
    (VMs). Keep in mind that the disruption may occur to system
    that are not being rebooted, but rely on services on those
    that are being rebooted.

  o Halt or suspend any VMs if this is a VM host (and be prepared
    to ensure they are restart after rebooting is complete.)
    (Use the "dims.shutdown" script to facilitate this. See
    documentation and/or "dims.shutdown --usage".)

  o Notify any active users to ensure no active development work
    is lost.
