This script is a simple wrapper for the dims_functions.sh library.

Call with arguments just as if you were doing so using functions
in the dims_functions.sh library. The following are equivalent:

    In a script:

        echo \$(get_vagrant_run_dir red.devops.local)
        /vm/run/red

    From command line:

        $ dims.function get_vagrant_run_dir red.devops.local
        /vm/run/red

To do recursive expansion of inline expressions (i.e., '\$(x)'),
be sure to "take away the magic" from characters that your
command line shell might try to interpret prior to passing
them to this script.

$ dims.function  'get_vagrant_status_by_id \$(get_vagrant_id red.devops.local)'
running

When the --debug flag is used, the script will attempt to load
dims_functions.sh from the current working directory. This allows
easier development and testing of the functions in this file.
If no file named "dims_functions.sh" exists in the CWD, the
system installed version is sourced instead.

Using the --show-help flag will extract the help text to
make it easier to determine the function names and/or how
they work.

To debug the dims_functions.sh library, you can enable tracing
as in other DIMS programs by using --verbose and --debug at the
same time.
