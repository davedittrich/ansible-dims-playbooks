# This script is intended to be usable during bootstrapping of a new
# virtual machine using Vagrant, Terraform, etc.  As such, it is
# assumed that this host has not yet been fully provisioned and the
# normal dims_functions.sh and shflags includes are not yet available.
# This means just minimal standard Bash functionality should be used.
