Upgrading and Updating Components
=================================

This chapter covers updating the ``ansible-dims-playbooks`` repo and related
private customization repository, upgrading operating system packages, and
generally keeping system components up to date.

.. _renewing_letsencrypt_certs:

Renewing Letsencrypt Certificates
---------------------------------

The imported role `ansible-role-certbot`_ that is being used
for `Letsencrypt`_ support creates a ``crontab`` entry in the ``ansible``
account to automatically renew the certificate when it is about to expire. You
can see the ``crontab`` entry using Ansible ad-hoc mode:

.. code-block:: none

    $ ansible -m shell -a 'crontab -l' trident
    yellow.devops.develop | SUCCESS | rc=0 >>
    #Ansible: Certbot automatic renewal.
    20 5 * * * /opt/certbot/certbot-auto renew --quiet --no-self-upgrade

    purple.devops.develop | SUCCESS | rc=0 >>
    #Ansible: Certbot automatic renewal.
    20 5 * * * /opt/certbot/certbot-auto renew --quiet --no-self-upgrade

..

You can always run this command whenever you want, again using
Ansible ad-hoc mode:

.. code-block:: none

    $ ansible -m shell -a '/opt/certbot/certbot-auto renew --no-self-upgrade' trident
    purple.devops.develop | SUCCESS | rc=0 >>
    Requesting root privileges to run certbot...
      /home/ansible/.local/share/letsencrypt/bin/letsencrypt renew --no-self-upgrade

    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Processing /etc/letsencrypt/renewal/breathe.prisem.washington.edu.conf
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The following certs are not due for renewal yet:
      /etc/letsencrypt/live/breathe.prisem.washington.edu/fullchain.pem (skipped)
    No renewals were attempted.Saving debug log to /var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log
    Cert not yet due for renewal

    yellow.devops.develop | SUCCESS | rc=0 >>
    Requesting root privileges to run certbot...
      /home/ansible/.local/share/letsencrypt/bin/letsencrypt renew --no-self-upgrade

    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Processing /etc/letsencrypt/renewal/echoes.prisem.washington.edu.conf
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The following certs are not due for renewal yet:
      /etc/letsencrypt/live/echoes.prisem.washington.edu/fullchain.pem (skipped)
    No renewals were attempted.Saving debug log to /var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log
    Cert not yet due for renewal

.. _updatingpycharm:

Updating PyCharm Community Edition
----------------------------------

Now that we have seen an example of setting variables at the host level
that override group variables, and validating the values of those variables
at run time, we will see how an example of upgrading the application.

PyCharm keeps all of its state, including settings, breakpoints, indexes, in internal
data stores in a directory specific to the version of PyCharm being used.  For example,
PyCharm 2016.2.3 files are kept in ``$HOME/.PyCharm2016.2``. When updating to the
release ``2016.3.1``, the location changes to ``$HOME/.PyCharmCE2016.3``. You need
to run PyCharm ``2016.2.3`` to export your settings, then run the new PyCharm
``2016.3.1`` version to import them.

To export settings, run PyCharm ``2016.2.3`` and select **File>Export
Settings...**. A dialog will pop up that allows you to select what to export and
where to export it. You can use the defaults (pay attention to where the exported
setting file is located, since you need to select it in the next step.) Select
**Ok** to complete the export. See Figure :ref:`exportsettings`.

PyCharm is installed using Ansible. The normal workflow for updating a component
like PyCharm is to test the new version to ensure it works properly, then update
the variables for PyCharm in the Ansible ``inventory`` before exporting your old
settings and then running the ``pycharm`` role for your development system.

.. TODO(dittrich): Add a cross-reference to running the playbook
.. todo::

    Add a cross-reference to running the playbook.

..

After PyCharm has been updated, select **File>Import Settings...** and select
the ``.jar`` file that was created in the previous step and then select **Ok**.
Again, the defaults can be used for selecting the elements to import.
See Figure :ref:`importsettings`.

   :alt: Importing Settings from PyCharm 2016.3.1

   Importing Settings to PyCharm 2016.3.1

..

Once you have completed this process and are successfully using version ``2016.3.1``,
you can delete the old directory.

.. code-block:: none

   $ rm -rf ~/.PyCharm2016.2

..

Identifying When Rebooting is Needed
------------------------------------

A ``bats`` system test exists to check to see if any packages were installed that
require a reboot.  This test is templated to tailor it for supported operating
systems.  Use the ``test.runner`` script to execute just the ``reboot`` test:

.. code-block:: none

    $ test.runner --match reboot
    [+] Running test system/reboot
     âœ— [S][EV] System does not require a reboot (Ubuntu)
       (in test file system/reboot.bats, line 8)
         `@test "[S][EV] System does not require a reboot (Ubuntu)" {' failed
       linux-image-4.4.0-87-generic
       linux-base
       linux-base

    1 test, 1 failure

..

.. todo::
