# File: tasks/dnsmasq.yml

# NOTE: Ubuntu 14.04 does not support dnsmasq anymore in a workable
# way. There is an incompatible pre-requisite with init-system-helpers
# that cannot be resolved using Ubuntu packages or backports.
# Instead, we're installing from source everywhere to stay
# consistent in version being used to avoid breaking things.
# (See also comments in roles/dns/tasks/main.yml)
