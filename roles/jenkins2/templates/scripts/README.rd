The job-scripts directory contains scripts run as part of Jenkins job build
steps. They are referenced by the Jenkins DSL scripts when creating/updating
jobs.

These scripts can also be run locally using optional parameters when testing.
To run on your local machine, you first need to install the scripts using
"make install" in the jenkins directory.
