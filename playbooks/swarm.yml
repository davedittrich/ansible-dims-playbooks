# This playbook is used to encapsulated the creation of a Swarm
# cluster using the published Ansible playbook from:
# https://github.com/nextrevision/ansible-swarm-playbook
#
# After running the playbook to establish the swarm on nodes
# in the 'manager' group, we then ensure that the defined
# networks exist, creating them if necessary by delegating
# to the first available Swarm manager node that was identified
# during execution of the swarm.yml task file.
