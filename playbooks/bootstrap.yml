# File: playbooks/bootstrap.yml

# This playbook is designed to facilitate bootstrapping a new
# computer, be it a server to act as a baremetal host, a developer
# laptop, or even a new virtual machine. This playbook is modelled
# on playbooks/base_playbook.yml.
#
# Example usage:
#
# $ ansible-playbook --become \
# > -i $GIT/private-develop/inventory \
# > $PBR/playbooks/bootstrap.yml -e host=red.devops.local

# Everything from here on out will be stripped by dims.ansible-playbooks
# in order to use this as a base for inserting roles (--role) or
# tasks (--task). This playbook can still function stand-alone and
# be run directly using ansible-playbook as described above.
