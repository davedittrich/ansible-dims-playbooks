# File: playbooks/base_playbook.yml

# This is a generic base playbook that is used to run any specific
# role on demand, as opposed to creating a proliferation of specific
# playbooks, one per role.  For more on why and how you use this,
# see:
#  o "Graduating Past Playbooks: How to Use Ansible When Your
#    Infrastructure Grows Up," by Bob McQueen.
#     http://nylas.com/blog/graduating-past-playbooks
#  o Ansible Playbooks documentation, section "Running DIMS playbooks".
#
#  $ cd $GIT/ansible-dims-playbooks
#  $ ansible-playbook -e host=host.fq.dn -e role=hello playbooks/base_playbook.yml
#  $ cat /tmp/hello.txt
#  b52
#
# Alternately, pass a JSON object to -e as follows:
#  $ ansible-playbook -e "{'host': 'host.fq.dn', 'role': 'hello', \
#  > 'debug': true, 'playbooks_root': '"$PBR"'}" playbooks/base_playbook.yml

# YOU MUST define at minimum the vars below. They are to be over-ridden
# using the precendence defined by Ansible for ansible and ansible-playbook
# command line programs. See Ansible documentation if you don't know what
# that means.

# Everything from here on out will be stripped by dims.ansible-playbooks

# tasks (--task). This playbook can still function stand-alone and
# be run directly using ansible-playbook as described above.
