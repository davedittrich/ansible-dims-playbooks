# File: handlers/restart_services.yml

# Handlers for restarting services. This file is modelled after
# the way the Fedora Project does things.
#
# This is the global service restart/reload definition file. It should
# be included in the handlers/main.yml file for each role that requires
# restarting services (i.e., installs or alters configuration files
# for a service daemon) as follows:
#
# - include: "{{ handlers_path }}/restart_services.yml"
#
# These handlers are just for restarting services. You should *not*
# be using "enabled=yes" here. Instead, in the tasks file where a
# service daemon is installed that needs to be running across reboots,
# a task should be included to ensure it is running and enabled at
# the end of the role's playbook, like this:
#
# - name: Ensure someservice is running and enabled
#   service:
#     name: someservice
#     state: running
#     enabled: yes
#   ...

# Note: Debian jessie and on use netfilter-persistent alongside of
# (sort of instead of) iptables-persistent, so we are chaining the
# handler for netfilter-persistent to be triggered in addition to
# iptables-persistent to force iptables rules to be loaded
# properly. See:
# https://www.reddit.com/r/debian/comments/3zmie1/debian_80_minimal_vps_iptables_persistent_issue/

# The following names for iptables/ip6tables handlers are
# derived in playbooks using facts to construct a dictionary
# key that is the name string.  See playbooks using "notify"
# for the base strings using a general form such as
# 'restart iptables .*' or 'restart ip6tables .*'
